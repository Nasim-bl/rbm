This study investigates the dynamic behavior of a system consisting of single-domain (SD) magnetic
dipoles under the influence of static magnetic fields. These dipoles are organized in a two-dimensional
triangular Bravais lattice and experience dipole-dipole interaction along with rotational Brownian
motion. By analyzing some thermodynamic parameters, such as magnetization, susceptibility, thermal
capacity, and magnetic energy, we observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking that signifies a continuous
phase transition in the absence of an external magnetic field. However, this phase transition vanishes
when a magnetic field is introduced within the lattice plane. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it can
still be sustained vertically, albeit only up to a critical threshold, by applying an external magnetic
field. By extrapolating data obtained from different lattice sizes, we have determined this threshold
to be approximately one-tenth of the average geomagnetic field strength in the thermodynamic limit.
This discovery holds significant implications for magnetic systems that involve long-term interactions
and exhibit continuous phase transitions, phenomena that models like the Ising model cannot explain.
Furthermore, it offers the potential to gain analytical insights into the interaction between biogenic
magnetic nanoparticles (MNs) and the geomagnetic fields in living organisms.
