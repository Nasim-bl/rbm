Build & Run
Requirements
•	Linux or macOS
•	g++ with C++11 support
•	make
•	Eigen3
•	OpenMP (optional but recommended)
Build
From the rbm/ directory (where the Makefile is located):
make release
A non-OpenMP build is also available:
make
Run
./rbm
On the first run, the code automatically generates J_inf.csv if it does not exist, and then starts the simulation.
Output
For each realization (r = 1 ... NR), the code writes result<r>.txt files containing magnetization, energy, Binder cumulant, and external field components.
All output files are written to the current directory.
Optional: Snapshots
Snapshots are disabled by default. To enable them, edit rbm.cpp and set:
#define DATA 1
Then rebuild and run again. Snapshot files will be written as snapshot<r>.txt.
Changing Simulation Mode
By default, the code performs a λ-sweep using:
execute(r);
Other simulation modes can be enabled by editing main() in rbm.cpp and rebuilding.
•	Hysteresis loop:
executeHysteresis(r, Vector3f(0.01, 0, 0), 1);
•	Rotating external magnetic field:
executeRotationalB(r, 1);
Cleaning Build Files
make clean
