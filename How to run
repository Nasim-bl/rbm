\b{(1) Get the code:}
Clone the repository and navigate to the rbm/ directory, which contains the Makefile and rbm.cpp.

2) Requirements: 
      Linux or macOS
      g++ with C++11 support
      make
      Eigen3 (header-only library)
      OpenMP (optional but recommended)

# 3) Build: 
    a) Recommended (OpenMP enabled): 
       make release
    b) Non-OpenMP build: 
       make

# 4) Run: 
    ./rbm
On the first run, the code automatically generates J_inf.csv if it does not exist.
You can also force regeneration using:
    ./rbm -Jinf

# 6) Output files
  For each realization r = 1 ... NR, the code generates:
    result<r>.txt

Each file contains magnetization, energy, Binder cumulant, external magnetic field components, and time evolution data.
All files are written to the current directory.


# 7) Optional: Snapshots
     Snapshots are disabled by default. 
     To enable them, edit rbm.cpp and set:
       #define DATA 1

Then rebuild and run again. Snapshot files will be written as snapshot<r>.txt.

# 8) Changing Simulation Mode: 
     Default mode:
        execute(r);

Other available modes (edit main() in rbm.cpp):
executeHysteresis(r, Vector3f(0.01, 0, 0), 1);
executeRotationalB(r, 1);

# 9) Compile-time parameters
    Important parameters are defined at the top of rbm.cpp, including:
      NR (number of realizations)
      L (lattice size)
      lambdaMax, ceq, tmax
      BDC0, BDC1 (external fields)


# 10) Cleaning Build Files: 
      make clean
